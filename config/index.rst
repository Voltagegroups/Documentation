Rules
=====
Although the Documentation API is free to be used in most applications and scenarios, we have certain rules and we will not grant increased limits for applications that violate these rules.

* You may not use the API for commercial purposes. All features that use the API must be private and belong to the group
* You can't leak the voltage data to benefit other servers.
* You may not use the API for continuous querying of data, such as asking the same player every minute to detect winning statistics in a game.
* Use of the API must comply with our `Terms of Service <cgu>`__.
